digimend-dkms (10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add support for Huion tilt reporting protocol.
  * Add support for Ugee Rainbow CV720. Thank you, Wang Xuerui!
  * Handle the new Huion product ID (006d), unlocking support for many new
    models.
  * Add support for 13th button on Huion tablet frames.
  * Do not expose unused input interfaces, to simplify code and reduce user
    confusion.
  * Support touch rings and strips on Huion devices. However, this requires
    the user-space Wacom drivers v0.34.99.1 or older for now. See way too many
    details about this in issue #275. Also note that Gnome has support for
    this broken.
  * Support dials on Huion devices.
  * Add support for Huion Q620M.
  * Add support for Huion HS611.
  * Add pen support for XP-Pen Star 06. Thank you, romanenkor!
  * Add digimend-debug tool. Now you can make debug messages to appear in your
    dmesg upon tablet connection, if you run sudo digimend-debug on first.
  * Fix multiple issues with compatibility with newer kernels and distros.

digimend-dkms (9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add support for XP-Pen G640.
  * Fix support for Ugee M540.
  * Fix support for Huion WH1409.
  * Add installation of X.org configuration, which requests the Wacom driver
    to handle all known compatible tablets, by default. Any X.org
    configuration for the same tablets in /etc would still override this.
  * Move installed hid-rebind to /lib/udev

digimend-dkms (8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Rework the UC-Logic driver to support the new Huion tablets, while keeping
    support of all the other tablets. This brings support for the following
    tablets (at least):
    - Huion H430P
    - Huion H640P
    - Huion H950P
    - Huion New 1060 Plus
    Thank you to Bj√∂rn Paetzel and Andrey Zabolotnyi for initial
    implementation and figuring out proximity detection, to Huion for tablet
    samples and financing the work, and to all the users for testing and bug
    reports!
  * Add support for Ugee G5.
    Thank you for the tablet sample and financing, Neoblast Inc.!
  * Add support for XP-Pen Deco 01.
    Thank you for the initial implementation and testing, kodkuce!
  * Add "dkms_install" and "dkms_uninstall" targets to the Makefile.
    These should be used now for installing and uninstalling the
    driver on all non-Debian based distros, as well as for installing and
    uninstalling the development versions of the driver. Use "install" and
    "uninstall" only if those didn't work (and report your issue).
  * Add "dist" target to the Makefile for building tarballs for external
    packaging. Thank you, Hai Hoang Dang!
  * Various documentation fixes and improvements.
