digimend-dkms (8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Rework the UC-Logic driver to support the new Huion tablets, while keeping
    support of all the other tablets. This brings support for the following
    tablets (at least):
    - Huion H430P
    - Huion H640P
    - Huion H950P
    - Huion New 1060 Plus
    Thank you to Bj√∂rn Paetzel and Andrey Zabolotnyi for initial
    implementation and figuring out proximity detection, to Huion for tablet
    samples and financing the work, and to all the users for testing and bug
    reports!
  * Add support for Ugee G5.
    Thank you for the tablet sample and financing, Neoblast Inc.!
  * Add support for XP-Pen Deco 01.
    Thank you for the initial implementation and testing, kodkuce!
  * Add "dkms_install" and "dkms_uninstall" targets to the Makefile.
    These should be used now for installing and uninstalling the
    driver on all non-Debian based distros, as well as for installing and
    uninstalling the development versions of the driver. Use "install" and
    "uninstall" only if those didn't work (and report your issue).
  * Add "dist" target to the Makefile for building tarballs for external
    packaging. Thank you, Hai Hoang Dang!
  * Various documentation fixes and improvements.
